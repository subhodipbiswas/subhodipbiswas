### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! This is Subhodip. Presently I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Veryfi, Inc. working on fraud detection. Previously, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Virginia Tech under the supervision of Naren Ramakrishnan. I have research experience in applied machine learning,  derivate-free optimization, graph algorithms, spatiotemporal data mining, and urban analytics.
